Problem statement
A number is called good if it's every digit (except the rightmost digit) is larger than the sum of digits on the right side of that digit.



Find all the good numbers in the range from 'a' to 'b' (both inclusive), such that none of them contains 'digit' as a digit.



Example :
Input: 'a' = 840, 'b' = 850 and 'digit' = 6

Output: Good numbers = [840, 841, 842, 843, 850]

Explanation: Consider 841:
8 > (4 + 1)
4 > 1
Since each digit is greater than the sum of digits on right (except 1, which does not have any digit on its right), 841 is a good number. Similarly, all these numbers are good.

Sample Input 1:
840 850
6


Sample Output 1:
840 841 842 843 850


Explanation of sample input 1 :
Consider 841:
8 > (4 + 1)
4 > 1
Since each digit is greater than the sum of digits on right (except 1, which does not have any digit on its right), 841 is a good number. Similarly, all these numbers are good.


Sample Input 2:
20 45
1


Sample Output 2:
20 30 32 40 42 43


Explanation of sample input 2 :
The good numbers in this range are:
20 21 30 31 32 40 41 42 43

Among these, 21, 31 and 41 have digit 1 in them, so they are not included.


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(b * log(b) - a * log(a)).


Constraints :
1 <= 'a' <= 'b' <= 10000
0 <= 'digit' <= 9

Time limit: 1 second


Time Complexity
O(b * log(b) - a * log(a)), Where 'a' and 'b' are the endpoints of the range given.

The time complexity of goodWithoutDigit(‘n’, ‘digit’) function is O(log ‘n’) since we are running a loop equivalent to the number of digits in ‘n’.

This function is called for each ‘i’ from ‘a’ to ‘b’. Therefore the time taken

= log(a) + log(a + 1) + log(a + 2) + … + log(b)

Since log(x) + log(y) = log(x * y)

Time taken = log(a * (a + 1) * … * b)

= log(b! / (a - 1)!) = log(b!) - log((a - 1)!)

Since O(n!) = O(n * log(n)) from Stirling's approximation,

Time complexity = O(b * log(b) - a * log(a))

Hence the time complexity is O(b * log(b) - a * log(a)).

Space Complexity
O(1)

We are using constant auxiliary space. The only space we are using is to store the valid good numbers in ‘ans’. The function calls are happening after previous ends, so constant stack space is used.

Hence the space complexity is O(1).



vector<int> goodNumbers(int a, int b, int digit) {
	// Write your code here.
	vector<int> ans;
	for(int i=a;i<=b;i++){
		int num=i;
		int sum=num%10;
		bool find=false;
		if(num%10==digit){
			find=true;
		}
		num/=10;
		
		while(num!=0){
			int d=num%10;
			if(d<=sum){
				find=true;
				break;
			}
			num=num/10;
			if(d==digit){
				find=true;
				break;
			}
			sum+=d;

		}
		if(!find){
			ans.push_back(i);
		}
	}
	return ans;

}
